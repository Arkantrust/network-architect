# Network Architect

As a network architect, your goal is to design and optimize a data center network within a given budget while meeting computational and spatial requirements.

Second project for the course of Algorithms and Data Structures I of ICESI University. Original requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10hhjAGeJ64UNWm14GvJy1Y3xHKX2kzeJjCLxbtblADg/edit?usp=sharing).

For the preliminary version of the game, the objective will be to connect some end user devices (phones, laptops, speakers, etc) on a smart home. The player will be able to use routers, switches, and servers (DNS, gateways) as nodes. And, UTP cables, wireless connections like Wi-Fi or other protocols like zigbee as edges.
