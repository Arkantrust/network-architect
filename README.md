# Network Architect

As a network architect, your goal is to design and optimize a data center network within a given budget while meeting computational and spatial requirements.

For the preliminary version of the game, the objective will be to connect some end user devices {phones, laptops, speakers, etc} on a WAN consisting of 5 houses, the player will be able to use routers, switches, and servers {DNS, gateways} as nodes. And, UTP cables, wireless connections like Wi-Fi or other protocols like zigbee as edges. This and maybe more.
