# Requirements

In this document you will find the assignment requirements, the game features and a mapping of the features and the requirements.
In the future, the game features will massively outnumber the requirements listed in the [instructions](./Instructions.md), however, due to the lack of time and energy I feel, I will only comply with the necessary requirements

## Assignment

- game modeled with graphs

- minimum 50 nodes and edges

- 2 versions of graph
  - adjacency matrix
  - adjacency list

- each version must be developed from the ADT to the unit tests

- at least 2 of the following algorithms must be used:
  - BFS
  - DFS
  - Dijkstra
  - Floyd-Warshall
  - Prim
  - Kruskal

- document and implement each of the [engineering design process](./design.md) phases for this problem (the game)

- toroughly document the analysis and design phases with:
  - [requirements specification document](./requirements.md)
  - [ADT design](./graph.md)
  - [class diagram]()
  - [unit tests design](./tests.md)

- GUI
